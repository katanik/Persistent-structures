# Persistent structures
Library for persistent structures such as a list, array, map.
The presented templates (PersistentList, PersistentArray, PersistentMap) model the standard operations of corresponding structures for different data types, but with effective support of unro/redo operations.

The cpp file contains functions for testing these structures on the command line.
